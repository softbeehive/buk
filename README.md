## Name and idea
It may seem wierd but I spent a day iterating through possible variants searching for a great name. Final result I came with was even better then expected. Because of its symbolism.

- Buk [bük] - means beech, a large tree with smooth grey bark and small nuts.
- Bukovina, Bucovina - historical region of Ukraine and Romania named of buk, lovely place I live.
- Book is homophone, kind of homonym, the most recognizable source of knowledge, don't forget what paper is made from.
- Board, in Ukrainian board and plank are homonyms as well, it is written and spelled as "дошка" [do':shka].

It perfectly combines idea and materia, its educational nature and representation.
